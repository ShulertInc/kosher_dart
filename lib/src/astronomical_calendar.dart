/// A Java calendar that calculates astronomical times such as [getSunrise], [getSunset] and twilight times. This class contains a [getCalendar] and can therefore use the standard
/// Calendar functionality to change dates etc... The calculation engine used to calculate the astronomical times can be
/// changed to a different implementation by implementing the abstract [AstronomicalCalculator] and setting it with
/// the [setAstronomicalCalculator]. A number of different calculation engine
/// implementations are included in the util package.
/// **Note:** There are times when the algorithms can't calculate proper values for sunrise, sunset and twilight. This
/// is usually caused by trying to calculate times for areas either very far North or South, where sunrise / sunset never
/// happen on that date. This is common when calculating twilight with a deep dip below the horizon for locations as far
/// south of the North Pole as London, in the northern hemisphere. The sun never reaches this dip at certain times of the
/// year. When the calculations encounter this condition a null will be returned when a
/// [DateTime] is expected and double.nan when a `long` is expected. The
/// reason that `Exception`s are not thrown in these cases is because the lack of a rise/set or twilight is
/// not an exception, but an expected condition in many parts of the world.
///
/// Here is a simple example of how to use the API to calculate sunrise.
/// First create the Calendar for the location you would like to calculate sunrise or sunset times for:
///
///
/// ```dart
///  String locationName = "Lakewood, NJ";
///  double latitude = 40.0828; // Lakewood, NJ
///  double longitude = -74.2094; // Lakewood, NJ
///  double elevation = 20; // optional elevation correction in Meters
///  // the String parameter in getTimeZone() has to be a valid timezone listed in
///  // [TimeZone.getAvailableIDs]
///  TimeZone timeZone = TimeZone.getTimeZone("America/New_York");
///  GeoLocation location = new GeoLocation(locationName, latitude, longitude, elevation, timeZone);
///  AstronomicalCalendar ac = new AstronomicalCalendar(location);
/// ```
///
/// To get the time of sunrise, first set the date you want (if not set, the date will default to today):
///
///
/// ```dart
///  ac.getCalendar().set(Calendar.MONTH, Calendar.FEBRUARY);
///  ac.getCalendar().set(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, 8);
///  Date sunrise = ac.getSunrise();
/// ```
///
